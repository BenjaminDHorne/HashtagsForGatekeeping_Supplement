# HashtagsForGatekeeping_Supplement

This repo contains the supplemental materials for the paper: "Hashtags for gatekeeping of COVID-19-related information on social media".

There are two types of figures in /ColoredFigures:
  1. Colored and Labeled Graphs, where the colors represent community membership (computed using modularity) and labels are the Twitter Screennames of selected hubs.
  2. Bots and Verified Graphs, where the colors represent if a node is a bot or verified.

The folder /GreyScaleFigures contains the same figures as displayed in the manuscript.
